    <h1> Is this making sense? </h1>
    <p> This will serve as a little exercise to see how well all this stuff is clicking, in addition to getting you comfortable with some more advanced styling techniques. This is a screenshot of a site. </p>

  <div class="boxes">
    <h2> 1. Some boxes in a row. </h2>
    <p> Here's a bunch of boxes <i>floated</i> next to each other with letters in the middle, but two of them are special. </p>

  <div class="cat">
    <h2> 2. This is a photo of a cat. </h2>
    <p> Drop an image of a cat here that fills the width of this column. You'll probably have to use something like width: 100;. And for that little guy (the highlighted code block), you'll have to use something like font-family: monospace;.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="link">
    <h2> 3. This is a big link. </h2>
    <p> When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click it, it opens up Google in another tab. You don't need to use a div for this. An a tag is an inline element, but you can make it a block element with css. </p>
